								<p>Changing your oil and the oil filter is one of the most critical procedures you can do for your car. Over time, engine heat begins to break down oil and creates sludge. Sludge can cause parts to wear out faster. It can have serious and costly consequences on your engine.</p>

								<p>Tire maintenance for motor vehicles is based on several factors. The chief reason for tire replacement is friction from moving contact with road surfaces, causing the tread on the outer perimeter of tires to eventually wear away. When the tread depth becomes too shallow (less than 0.125in./3.2mm), the tire is worn out and should be replaced. The same wheels can usually be used throughout the lifetime of the car.</p>

								<div class="seperator">
									<div class="triangle"></div>
								</div>
								<p>Brake calipers, pads and rotors all work together to stop your vehicle. When you step on your brake pedal, the master cylinder sends fluid to the brake calipers which squeeze together, exerting pressure on the brake pads. It's important to inspect your calipers often for signs of wear or damage.</p>
