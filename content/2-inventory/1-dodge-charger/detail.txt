It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Belligerent and numerous. Your best is an idiot! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. I had more, but you go ahead. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Who are those horrible orange men? Why did you bring us here?
